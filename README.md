# React Static Comp

This React static comp was my first experience building a website out with react. We were given all the assets and a basic set up of the JavaScript and CSS files. Then from there we were tasked with writing JSX, passing props, and writing some CSS. We were also in charge of putting in the proper breakpoints so that the comp would be fully responsive and could go from desktop all the way to mobile.
